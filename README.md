# 📈 How Bitcoin Shifts the Efficient Frontier  
*A Walk-Forward Multi-Objective Optimization Study in Python*

---

## 🧭 Overview

This project investigates whether adding **Bitcoin (BTC)** to a traditional **equity portfolio** improves **risk-adjusted performance** under *realistic market frictions*.  

Using a **walk-forward mean–variance optimization** framework, we explore how a capped BTC allocation affects the **out-of-sample efficient frontier**, accounting for practical constraints such as transaction costs, shrinkage, and rolling covariance estimation.

The results demonstrate that even a **small, capped BTC sleeve** (≤10%) can **shift the efficient frontier upward**, improving Sharpe and Calmar ratios while maintaining stable volatility.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The study employs a **walk-forward mean–variance optimizer** with:

- **Long-only constraints**: $ w \ge 0, \; \mathbf{1}^\top w = 1 $
- **BTC allocation cap**: $ w_{\text{BTC}} \le 0.10 $
- **EWMA covariance** with decay factor $ \lambda = 0.94 $
- **Shrinkage** for both means and covariances
- **Rolling winsorization** to reduce tail risk
- **Turnover costs** of 10 basis points per round trip
- **Intersected trading-day calendar** for ETF + BTC synchronization

## 🧮 Mathematical Formulation

The scalarized mean–variance objective for a given \( \alpha \in [0,1] \) is:

$
J_\alpha(w) = (1 - \alpha)\, w^\top \Sigma w - \alpha\, \mu^\top w
$

subject to:

$
w \ge 0, \quad \mathbf{1}^\top w = 1, \quad w_{\text{BTC}} \le 0.10
$

Weights are updated using **projected gradient descent** with re-projection onto the simplex and optional capping.

## 🔁 Walk-Forward Optimization Procedure

1. **Estimate** parameters (μ, Σ) on a rolling window of `lookback_days = 63`.
2. **Hold** the optimized weights for `hold_days = 63` out-of-sample.
3. **Apply turnover cost** at each rebalance.
4. **Repeat** across all rolling windows and aggregate out-of-sample results.
5. **Compare** Stocks-only vs. Stocks+BTC portfolios across an α-grid.

## 📊 Key Results

At the same risk-aversion level \( (\alpha = 0.95) \):

| Portfolio        | Sharpe | Return | Volatility | Max DD | Calmar |
|------------------|:------:|:-------:|:------------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Stocks-only      | 0.60   | 8.31%   | 13.93%       | −35.5%  | 0.23    |
| Stocks + BTC (10%) | **0.86** | **12.27%** | **14.34%** | −39.9%  | **0.31** |

Average realized BTC weight ≈ **5.8%**, never reaching the 10% cap — confirming that performance gains stem from **diversification**, not from concentrated exposure.

---

## 📈 Visual Highlights

- **Walk-Forward Efficient Frontier:** BTC curve consistently dominates the stocks-only curve.  
- **Cumulative Equity Growth:** BTC-enhanced portfolio exhibits higher long-term compounding.  
- **BTC Weight Path:** Average weight remains stable and below cap throughout the test period.

---

## 🧩 Interpretation

- BTC acted as a **decorrelated risk premium**, improving multi-asset efficiency.  
- The effect persisted even with realistic frictions (winsorization, turnover costs).  
- The improvement reflects **cross-asset diversification**, not speculative risk-taking.

## 🧠 Future Extensions

Potential next steps for deeper analysis:

- **Cap sensitivity**: 5%, 10%, 20% BTC allocation tests  
- **Rebalance cadence**: monthly vs. quarterly  
- **Expanded universes**: add bonds, commodities, or gold  
- **Regime conditioning**: activate BTC only in risk-on environments  
- **Risk-target optimization**:  
  $
  \min_{w} w^\top \Sigma w \quad \text{s.t. } \mu^\top w \ge R^*
